            <p>Clay soil, renowned for its fine particles and high water retention capacity, presents both challenges and opportunities for crop fertility. Its pH levels, ranging from acidic to alkaline, play a crucial role in influencing nutrient availability and overall crop performance.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-left" class="workBx">
            <p>One of the notable characteristics of clay soil is its tendency to have low levels of organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK). However, despite these initial limitations, clay soil possesses a dense structure that can effectively retain applied nutrients, albeit requiring careful management to prevent nutrient leaching and runoff.</p>
        <div data-aos="flip-right" class="workBx">
            <p>Crop evaluation on clay soil involves addressing its unique physical properties, including poor drainage and compaction issues. While some crops like wheat, corn, and soybeans may thrive in clay soil with appropriate management practices, others may struggle due to challenges such as waterlogging or root restriction.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-offset="100" class="workBx">
            <p>To optimize crop productivity on clay soil, farmers employ various strategies such as incorporating soil amendments like organic matter and gypsum. These amendments help improve soil structure, enhance nutrient availability, and mitigate compaction issues. Additionally, implementing conservation tillage practices and selecting suitable crop varieties further contribute to overcoming the challenges associated with clay soil, ultimately enhancing agricultural sustainability and productivity.</p>
