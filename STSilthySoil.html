            <p>Silty soil, characterized by its fine, nutrient-rich particles, is a cornerstone of crop fertility, boasting high levels of organic matter and excellent moisture retention properties.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-left" class="workBx">
            <p>Featuring a pH range typically spanning from neutral to slightly acidic, silty soil creates an advantageous environment for crops to access essential nutrients, fostering robust growth and yield potential.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-right" class="workBx">
            <p>Crop evaluation on silty soil involves careful assessment of its texture, drainage, and nutrient availability. This soil type is particularly conducive to the cultivation of crops like wheat, barley, soybeans, and certain vegetables, which thrive in its well-drained yet moisture-retentive composition.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-offset="100" class="workBx">
            <p>To optimize productivity on silty soil, farmers implement strategic soil testing to gauge nutrient levels and pH balance accurately. Tailored fertilization and irrigation practices are then employed to enhance crop performance, ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and long-term soil fertility on silty soil farmland.</p>
